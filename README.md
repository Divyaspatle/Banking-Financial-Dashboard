The project showcases the use of Excel, SQL, and dashboard tools such as Power BI & Tableau for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

SQL To extract relevant data from the Banking Finance datasets, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order.

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Banking Finance data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering of the data Drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of detail in the data.

Tableau is used To visualize and analyze the Banking Finance data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards.
